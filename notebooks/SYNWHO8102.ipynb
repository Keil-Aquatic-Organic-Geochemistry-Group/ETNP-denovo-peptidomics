The temperature is pretty irrelevent to me, as it was between 18 and 22 degrees C. Also, I know the culture was in logarithmic stage at harvesting: 'Cultures were grown at 18 °C and 22 °C under constant illumination of 20 μmol photons m−2 s−1 and agitation at 100 r.p.m. Cultures were acclimated to experimental temperature conditions through three successful serial transfers (8 generations total) before harvesting cells in logarithmic phase' ###\n",
