## 2017 ETNP sequence data processing workflow in Jupyter notebooks

### How I processed de novo and databased ID'd peptide data using bash, R, and Unipept 

1. Data exported from PEAKS 8.5; used default text-based export file settings with addition of protein .fasta file

2. Renamed all files to include Keil proteomics running number and PEAKS DB search #, i.e., for sample 375:
  >375-peaks3-DB-search-psm.txt
  >375-peaks3-dno.txt
  >375-peaks3-peptide.txt
  >375-peaks3-protein-peptides.txt
  >375-peaks3-protein.txt
  >375-peaks3-protein.fasta
