What it is:

Broadly, part of work to illuminate details of carbon cycling. How does organic matter break down, particularly in dymanic regions like an oxygen deficient zone?  Here we use a new approach to environmental protein sequencing, de novo-assisted sequencing, to better detect the protineacous organic matter of both living and degraded organisms. 

These data are from a January 2017 cruise on the R/V Sikuliaq to the eastern tropical North Pacific. We extracted protein from suspended material (collected with McLane *in situ* pumps) and from sinking material (collected with sediment trap-incubator systems). 

This repository also contains data and analyses from a preliminary culture study to evaluate the usefulness and bias of de novo-assisted peptide sequencing. The MS/MS data is from extracted protein of a *Prochloroccus marinus* strain MED4 collected on a Thermo QExactive HF
