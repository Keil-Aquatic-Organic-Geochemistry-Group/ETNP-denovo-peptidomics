What it is:

Broadly, this work is part of a larger effort to illuminate details of carbon cycling. How does organic matter break down, particularly in dymanic regions like an oxygen deficient zone?  Here we use a new approach to environmental protein sequencing, de novo-assisted sequencing, to better detect the protineacous organic matter, both living and degraded, made by organisms in this dynamic environment. Because the amino acid sequences of peptides can be specific to the organism that made them, as well as to the function of the protein, sequencing represents a powerful mining of potential information about community function. Furthermore, proteins are important components of the total organic matter pool. Therefore, details of their production, degradation, recycling, and preservation matter critically to how carbon and nitrogen cycle throughout the ocean over short and long time scales. 

These data are from a January 2017 cruise on the R/V Sikuliaq to the eastern tropical North Pacific. We extracted protein from suspended material (collected with McLane *in situ* pumps) and from sinking material (collected with sediment trap-incubator systems). 

This repository also contains data and analyses from a preliminary culture study to evaluate the usefulness and bias of de novo-assisted peptide sequencing. The MS/MS data is from extracted protein of a *Prochloroccus marinus* strain MED4 collected on a Thermo QExactive HF by Rachel Lundeen.
